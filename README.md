## Overview  
**Mirage** is a Data Science-inspired movie storytelling project that combines analytical insights with creative storytelling. The project uses data science techniques to craft an interactive narrative experience, complete with visuals and dialogue analysis. This repository contains scripts, data, and visualizations that bring this story to life.

---

## Objectives  
- Develop a creative narrative leveraging **movie dialogues** and **data-driven insights**.  
- Use **data science tools and techniques** to analyze, process, and visualize the story elements.  
- Create an engaging and visually appealing **storybook experience** using interactive notebooks and media assets.

## Project Components  

1. **Movie Dialogue Analysis**  
   - Source: `movie_dialogues.csv` contains the movie's dialogue dataset.  
   - Analysis involves sentiment classification, keyword extraction, and context mapping to understand the flow of the story.  

2. **Notebook 1: Story Processing (`Movie_Mirage.ipynb`)**  
   - Extracts, processes, and sequences the dialogues to craft the story.  
   - Includes natural language processing (NLP) techniques like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and context alignment.

3. **Notebook 2: Poster Creation (`MoviePoster.ipynb`)**  
   - Generates an artistic movie poster using **image processing** and visualization tools.  
   - Adds a creative touch to represent the theme of the movie visually.

4. **Media Assets**  
   - **Poster Image**: `poster.jpg` is the final movie poster generated for the project.  
   - **Visualization Outputs**: Charts, word clouds, and scene breakdowns to complement the narrative.
